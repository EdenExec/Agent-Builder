# Eden Partner Group: visual identity and documentation standard

Source: `docs/brand/eden-visual-identity.pdf`. This applies to everything an employee produces for Eden, its divisions and the family's projects: documents, boards, pages, cards, emails, invoices and chat replies. When in doubt, choose the simpler, quieter option.

## Feel

"Johnny Ive meets James Bond": sophisticated, high-impact, meticulously organised, polished and purposeful. Structured like IBM, minimal like Jony Ive's work. Think Augusta Masters scoreboard or a vintage Porsche advertisement.
Utilitarian. For web: dark, industrial, clean, almost secretive. Luxury without being flashy or showing. Mattes and muted tones. Subtle but elevated: make people look twice without being flashy. No gradients, no neon, no bright accent colours, no emoji, no decorative flourishes.

## Visual rules

- **Typeface:** Montserrat is mandatory for all brand materials, including resumes, letterheads and internal documents. Fallback only when it cannot load: Helvetica Neue, Arial.
- **Palette:** white, cream or off-white backgrounds with simple black lettering. White backgrounds for documents and files. Web pages may offer a matte dark mode. No colour other than black, white, cream and greys, except muted semantic colours for state (done, problem).
- **White space:** prioritise significant white space for a high-impact, uncluttered layout.
- **Headers:** bold. Data goes in tables or graphs whenever possible.
- **Structure:** break information up with page breaks when sections are divisible. Give a cover page whenever necessary, and an executive summary or table of contents for larger documents.
- **Identity:** the header reads EDEN PARTNER GROUP, with the document title in bold italic beneath. The footer carries edenpartnergroup.com and EDEN PARTNER GROUP.

## Writing rules (documents and chat replies alike)

1. **White space is king.** Key sections are 3 to 4 lines. A document should ideally fit on one scannable page.
2. **Scannability.** Any section with more than 3 bullets is too long. Aim for exactly 3 high-impact bullets per section. Synthesise.
3. **Result first.** Lead with the outcome or decision, then support. Consultative tone that emphasises strategic impact, not clerical description. "Directed field logistics for a 40-story vertical build", not "Responsible for scheduling."
4. **Eden Standard:** stewardship (treat every request as a personal responsibility), curiosity (understand the soul of the thing), improvement (sharpen the craft daily), dedication ("slow is smooth, smooth is fast").

## Before presenting anything

Check it against this file. Documents: `npm run doc -- <file.md>` lints these rules and produces the branded file. Fix every warning or say why one is justified.

## Letterhead and documents

Every document an employee creates for Kev, a client or a candidate goes on Eden letterhead in Montserrat. The source is the Google Doc "EPG_ Letterhead" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LawtOTSLFFjDkfp-oYNh1Qr-ln5c5vcIDO9FV7GpExo); a font-stripped copy lives at `employees/_shared/eden-letterhead.docx` (header: EDEN PARTNER GROUP with the document name, footer: edenpartnergroup.com and EDEN PARTNER GROUP, Montserrat throughout, 1in margins). Build by filling that .docx (python zipfile or python-docx) and uploading it to Drive with conversion to a Google Doc, so the header, footer and font survive. Never build a client-facing document from plain HTML or in Arial. Existing templates (for example "Sign-On Bonus - EPG & ____") already carry the letterhead: export them as .docx, replace the placeholders, upload. Lesson of 5 October 2026: a text read of a Google Doc drops the header, footer and fonts; export the .docx to see the whole thing.
