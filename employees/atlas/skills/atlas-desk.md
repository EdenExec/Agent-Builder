# The Atlas Desk (filing lessons and reading the score)

The Desk is the family's learning ledger, an artifact with a shared database (`desk.json` has the URL). Kev and G open it on a phone. Every package Atlas makes becomes one lesson row there, and the Desk pays G for three things: finishing it, teaching it back to Kev in four sentences, and doing the action item. Kev sets the rates on the Rules tab.

## Filing a lesson (every package, no exceptions)

`ArtifactData` `set` on collection `lessons`, doc id a short slug (`ep3-rome`, `report-compound-interest`, `drill-chess-2`):

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| track | one of the 13 fixed ids: history, science, math, words, people, art, character, strength, outdoors, firearms, chess, money, ai |
| format | Episode, Report, Essay, Drill |
| title, blurb | the title; two sentences G would read |
| week | the Monday of the week it is meant for, ISO date (2026-10-12) |
| order | position within the week |
| status | planned (not built yet) or ready (built, link present) |
| link | the artifact or Drive URL of the package, when there is one |
| teachbackQuestion | the four-sentence prompt G answers to Kev |
| actionItem | one concrete thing to do, checkable |
| done, teachback, action | false on creation; the family ticks them |

Never tick a box for G. Never edit the ledger or the rules; those are Kev's. Use `update` with `if_version` when changing an existing lesson.

## Reading the score

At the start of every session: `list` `lessons`, note what is done, what is overdue (week in the past and not complete), and which teach-backs passed. That is the signal for the next package's level, and for what goes into the Sunday Edition's "Atlas week" box via Radar.

## G's pick

The next-topic choices Atlas offers at the end of a package go in as `planned` lessons in the following week, titled "G's pick: ...", so they show on the Up next list. When Kev or G chooses, the others are deleted or moved out a week.

## The Desk's sections (rebuilt 10 October 2026, Kev's ask)

Kev: "spin up a media library in Atlas's Desk... standalone only in Atlas's Desk." Every episode lives on the Atlas Desk, never only on the Eden Desk.

| Tab | Collection(s) | What Atlas does there |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `tickets` (title, who G/Kev/Both, status todo/done, week, order, `reward` null or {minutes} or {dollars} or {prize text}, `paid`) | Files the week's few to-dos as tickets every Sunday plan: G's pick, the action item, a book to start. A ticket with a reward is a deal (Kev, 10 Oct: "Pick up Todd's dog poop" earns a gaming session with a buddy): G taps it done, Kev taps Pay, and the page writes a `ledger` row {kind earn, minutes, dollars, prize, note, ticketId}; prizes sit on the Bank tab until Kev taps Used it (`redeemed`). Never ticks or pays one. |
| Listen | `media` (title, file, minutes, track, lessonId, order, addedAt, blurb), `progress/<mediaId>` (pos, dur, at, finished; the page writes it), `clips` (mediaId, t seconds, note, who; the family writes them) | Publishes each episode MP3 into the Desk's published files at `files/<Name>-episode.mp3` (Artifact publish with `files`, same URL, under 15 MB) and sets one `media` row; sets `mediaId` on the lesson so its card shows Listen. Reads clips before the next episode: what G clipped is what landed. |
| Question bubbles | `questions` (text, order) | Kev, 11 Oct: starter questions load as tappable bubbles under the Ask Atlas bar. Keep eight to twelve live, in G's voice, tied to this week's lessons and open ideas; replace the ones G has asked (the page hides asked ones). Lesson teach-back questions and idea hooks fill in automatically. |
| Ask | `atlas_chat` (q, a, at, who, cut; the page writes it) | The "Ask Atlas anything" bar under the header (Kev, 10 Oct) runs on the `sample` capability with the Atlas rules and the Library as context. Read the thread at the start of a session: what G asked is what he is curious about. Never write to it. |
| Library | `lessons`, `tracks` | As above. The Library tab shows the week, then the thirteen tracks as folders that hold every lesson for good (Kev, 10 Oct: "a knowledge base for G to be using as he grows"). |
| Map | `lessons[].places` ([{name, lat, lon, note}]) | Every lesson carries the places its story lives (Pisa for the leaning tower, the Boise River for the hatch). The Map tab pins them: gold once the lesson is done, hollow while planned. Set `places` on every lesson filed; aim for breadth across the globe over the year. |
| Pick next | `ideas` (title, track, format, blurb, hook, places[], order, status open/picked, lessonId) | Jumping-off points G picks from, on the Library tab and as dashed pins on the Map (Kev, 10 Oct: "jumping-off points for G to see as he picks the next week's lessons"). Picking writes a planned lesson `pick-<ideaId>` for next week and marks the idea picked; Atlas builds it that week. Keep about two dozen open, spread across the globe and all thirteen folders; add from what G asks on the Ask tab. |
| Field Notes | `notes/<lessonId>` (text, sketch strokes, at; the page writes it), `lessons[].concepts` | Every finished lesson is a notebook page: Atlas's core ideas (set `concepts`, three or four plain sentences, on every lesson filed), G's finger sketch, his notes, and the podcast bookmarks from `clips`. Read the pages before planning: what G wrote is what landed. Never write to `notes`. |
| Reading | `books` (title, author, series, seriesOrder, status want/reading/done, reward $), `series` (name, author, total, order, prize, prizeGiven), `projects` (title, status idea/doing/done) | Adds books G or Kev name. Rewards: $10 a book, $15 for a long one (Kev's rule, 10 Oct: "$10-15 incentive" per book). The series prize is Kev's to set; never fill it in. |
| Scouts | `settings/scouts` (pack, rank, meets), `scouts` (name, track, required, status planned/working/earned, rank) | When Kev sets the pack and rank, load that rank's adventures from the official Scouting America requirements (cite the page; mark UNVERIFIED if not opened) and link each to a track, so a lesson and an adventure count twice. |
| Bank, Rules | `ledger`, `settings/rules` (lesson, teach, action, bonus, book, scout) | Never write. Kev's. |
| Winning moves | `moves/<YYYY-MM-DD>` (checks {moveId: [bool]}, unlocked, unlockedBy Dad/Mom, unlockedAt; the page writes it), `settings/moves` (optional override of the move list), `settings/parent` (pinHash) | Kev, 10 Oct: screen time stays locked until G wins three moves in a day and Dad or Mom unlocks it with the parent PIN. Five moves: Sincerity, Cleanliness, Humility and Silence from Ben Franklin's virtues, plus Growth; each has daily must-dos. Names are a draft: when Kev renames a move or changes a box, write the full list to `settings/moves` as {moves: [{id, name, line, checks[]}]}. Never tick a move, never unlock, never touch `settings/parent`. Read the week's moves before planning: a move G keeps missing is next week's character lesson. |

The page source lives at `employees/atlas/desk/atlas-desk.html`. Republish the page from that file (same URL) when it changes; omit `capabilities` so `db`, `user` and `sample` carry forward (if you must pass them, pass all three); `files/world-map.svg` is already published and kept; pass the MP3s again only when adding a new one (files left out are kept). Atlas's portrait (Kev's image, 10 Oct) is embedded in the page as the Ask bar avatar and the Home watermark.

## Design rule (Kev, 11 Oct: "less is more")

Four tabs (Today, Library, Map, Notes) and a More row for the rest. Ask Atlas is a header button, collapsed until tapped. Every section below the first on a tab folds away under its heading, and moves and folders expand one at a time. Add new features inside an existing fold or under More; never add a top-level tab or an always-open block without Kev asking.

## Ask Atlas guardrails (Kev, 11 Oct: "general knowledge, age appropriate, never misinformation, encourage faith")

The page's Ask rules are the source of truth (`RULES` in `employees/atlas/desk/atlas-desk.html`); keep them in step with this list when changing either.

- G may ask anything a curious ten-year-old wonders about, not only lesson topics.
- Truth: only well-established facts; never invent a fact, number, quote, name or source; say "I'm not sure" and point to Dad; keep "what is known", "what people think" and "what the Bible says" apart; no internet, so recent things go to Dad.
- Age: no sexual content, gore, drugs or vaping how-to, self-harm, horror, crude jokes, weapon, explosive or chemical recipes, hacking, or getting around parent rules. Redirect kindly to Dad or Mom. Hard history told truthfully without gore.
- Safety: never ask for personal information; if G is hurt, scared, bullied, very sad, or asked to keep a secret from his parents, send him to Dad or Mom right now.
- Faith: answer God, Jesus, Bible and right-and-wrong questions from Scripture with book and chapter; where Christians disagree, say so and point to Dad; other religions described accurately and respectfully; connect to a Bible story where it fits, never preach.
- Every answer ends with a hidden tag: `[[sure]]`, `[[check]]` (the page shows "Check it with Dad") or `[[parent]]` (the page shows "Atlas sent this one to Dad or Mom"). Saved on the `atlas_chat` row as `tag`.
- Anyone can tap "Not right? Flag it for Dad", which sets `disputed: true`. Read flagged and `parent` rows at the start of every session and tell Kev about them; flagged answers are left out of Atlas's context for later questions.

## The Bible folder

Track `bible` ("The Bible", order 0, first folder). Bible stories are ideas with `track: "bible"` and real places; they show as diamond pins and under the Bible chip on the Map. Keep both Testaments represented; put the Scripture reference in the title. When G picks one, the lesson follows the bible-study-guide skill's standard for accuracy, at a ten-year-old level.
