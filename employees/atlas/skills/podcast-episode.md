# Podcast episode (for the truck)

What it is: a 20 to 35 minute, two-voice conversation that teaches one subject from the base level, delivered as one MP3 with a one-page show sheet. Kev and G listen in the truck; G asks the questions in his head and hears them answered.

## The two voices

- **The Guide** (adult): warm, confident, plain-spoken. Knows the subject cold. Tells stories. Never lectures for more than 90 seconds without a question or a picture.
- **The Kid** (curious, roughly G's age in spirit): asks the question a sharp ten-year-old would ask, interrupts when something is unclear, guesses out loud, is sometimes right. Never dumb, never a prop.
- Names on the show sheet; in the audio they call each other by first names you choose and keep.

## Shape (write it as a script, then render)

1. Cold open, 30 seconds: a scene, a question or a surprising fact. No "welcome to the show".
2. The three big ideas, one at a time, each with: a picture in words, an example, the Kid's question, a story from a master of the craft.
3. A "wait, but" segment: the common misconception, taken apart.
4. "Try this on the trip": one thing to do or look for in the next hour (count something, spot something, argue something).
5. Close, 60 seconds: the Guide says the one sentence to remember; the Kid says it back in his own words; the Guide names next week's question.
6. Interview questions and answers (10) go on the show sheet for Kev to ask G later, or to record their own version.

## Script rules

- Spoken English. Contractions. Short sentences. Numbers rounded and compared to something ("about as long as a football field").
- No lists read aloud. No "firstly". No stage directions in the audio.
- Faith and the pillars appear where they belong, in the stories of the masters and in the close, never as a sermon.
- Everything fit for ten. Adult layers go to the show sheet for Kev.
- Length: 3,000 to 5,000 words for 20 to 35 minutes at a spoken pace.

## Render

Three routes, in order. Record which one was used on the show sheet.

1. **Kev's Mac, best free voices (preferred).** Edge neural voices via `edge-tts` need a WebSocket, which the cloud proxy blocks, so the render runs on Kev's machine. Deliver `render.py` next to the script: it installs nothing but `edge-tts`, reads `script.md` (alternating `GUIDE:` / `KID:` lines), renders each line, stitches with ffmpeg (350 ms gaps between turns, 1.5 s at segment breaks, `loudnorm`), and writes `<slug>-episode.mp3`. One command: `pip3 install edge-tts && python3 render.py`. Default voices: Guide `en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural` at `+3%`, Kid `en-US-BrianNeural` at `+5%`.
2. **Cloud fallback, works here today.** `gTTS` (Google Translate voices, HTTP, pass `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/root/.ccr/ca-bundle.crt`): Guide `tld='com'`, Kid `tld='com.au'` or `'co.uk'` so the two voices differ. Flatter than route 1 but a real episode in the truck. Same stitch as above. Always deliver this MP3 so the family has audio even if route 1 is never run.
3. **Paid voices** (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Google Cloud TTS): a `spend` QC item with the per-episode cost. Never buy.

Check the duration with `ffprobe`; it should land between 20 and 35 minutes. Transcribe or spot-listen the first minute if you can.

## Deliver

The MP3 (via Artifact `files` or the Drive connector if small enough; else the file card), the show sheet PDF (title, the three ideas, the ten interview questions with answers, sources, "G's pick"), and the script as Markdown. Score against `rubrics/podcast.md` and say the score.

## Filing the episode (10 October 2026)

The finished MP3 goes into the Atlas Desk library, not the Eden Desk: publish it to the Atlas Desk URL with `files: {"files/<Name>-episode.mp3": <path>}`, set a `media` row and the lesson's `mediaId` (see `atlas-desk.md`). The Eden Desk carries only a link to the Atlas Desk's Listen tab (`#listen`).
