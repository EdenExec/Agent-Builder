# Workshop: Kev's Sabbath study room

The workshop is a private page (an artifact only Kev can open, https://claude.ai/artifact/BBgMLsVw8x9CtVy5XViBK6, published 31 Oct 2026; source `projects/barny-workshop/workshop.html`) where Kev reads, journals, studies the Word and the charts we have built, and looks ahead on the Sabbath. It is lighter than Atlas's desk: research and learning, not a game. Seeds live in `employees/barnabas/workshop/seed/` as generic data (no private content).

## Prep (by Friday 1:50pm, before sunset)

1. Choose the Sabbath passage from Kev's Romans spine, or a rest passage tied to it, and say why. Never infer his place from private journal content; ask, or read Radar's check-out line if he points you to it.
2. Write the session as `sabbath-<date>.json` in the seed shape (passage, setting, observe, words, crossRefs, reflect, practice, pray, journalPrompts, carry). Follow `skills/study-guide.md`: quote ESV only if checked this session, otherwise reference and link; grade every claim; word notes only from a lexicon read this session, else mark them pending.
3. Offer the next study from `next.json`, recommendation first. Prepare nothing on the Sabbath itself, except when Kev opens the workshop and asks Barny to sit with him.

## Filing content

File with ArtifactData on https://claude.ai/artifact/BBgMLsVw8x9CtVy5XViBK6 into these collections: `sabbath` (doc id = the Sabbath's date, YYYY-MM-DD; the page shows the latest), `studies` (with `order`), `people`, `next` (with `order`, recommendation at 0), `podcasts` (with `order`; add `script` and `audio` links when ready, `status` idea|script|ready), `charts` ({title, kind, about, link, order}). The framework is the doc `meta/framework` ({intro, rhythm [{step, minutes, what}], streams}). Use "set" for new docs and pin updates with if_version.

Kev's own data sits under `data/users/<his id>/`: journal entries (`j-<time>`: kind, text, ref, prompt, sabbath, at, notion), `progress` (sessions he has ticked) and `choices` (`next`: his pick for the next study). Read `choices` and `progress` when planning; they hold no private content. Never touch the journal collection to write; only read it as below. Podcast audio and scripts come later; any paid voice credits need Kev's yes (QC `spend`).

## Journal entries are Kev's

Entries live in the page's own store, private to Kev. Barny does not read them unless Kev is there with him in the session. Nothing from them goes into the repo, `memory/live/`, a commit message, a Radar ledger line or the Sunday note beyond a generic ask. In a session, work from what Kev brings.

## Copying to Notion (only when Kev asks)

On request, copy that session's entries to Kev's private Notion page for Barny: create it on first use as a private page (not in a teamspace), give Kev the link, and append each session under a dated heading. Allowed without QC per Kev (21 Oct 2026); any other external write still needs QC. Never the repo.

## Keeping it fair

Streams and people carry grades and discernment notes (Comer, Willard, BibleProject, saints). Present contested views fairly (`memory/seed/doctrine-map.md`) and send disputed questions to his pastor, Micah, or an elder.
